# Journal It 1.0

**A timer application, inspired by chess stopwatches.**

This application was developed as a side project back in 2015. At the time I was task switching between billable projects for an employer. Understandably, my employer required detailed reports so that costs could be allocated. Therefore, I needed a method of recording my time and to quickly switch tasks, like a chess timer.

In the 2000’s I worked for several law firms. They all used an application called [Carpe Diem]( https://www.oneadvanced.com/products/carpe-diem-time-recording/). A feature of this application was “SmarTimers”.

With this image to hand I set about building my own version.

At the time it proved to be successful. Overtime more and more colleagues used it.

Please note **MS Excel** is required to export timer data to a spreadsheet.
